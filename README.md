# Mastigacao (Chewing)

A simple app for helping people who chew very quickly, which can result in different health problems.

It works like a metronome for the user, sending an "impulse" every second.

The app works in three ways:

- Visual: the device alternate the screen color between red and blue. It allows the user to use peripheral vision while eating.
- Vibration: the device sends a pulse every second. It allows the user to use the app quietly.
- Both: The user can activate both resources above. The device being over a surface, it can make noise with the vibration mode and can blink at the same time.
